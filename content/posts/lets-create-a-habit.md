Welcome to Just Words.

My goal here is to write. I intend to write every day, for the next 100 days, about anything that’s bugging my mind, as a way to improve my written English.

It’s hard to create a habit. I know. That’s why I’m not committing to any metrics besides post written. Another strategy I intend to use is to connect this new, in construction, habit to an established one. This way, I think it may be easier to “remember” to write here.

It took me 40+ minutes to write those 89 word above.
