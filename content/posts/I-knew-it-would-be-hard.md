It’s been 174 days since my [last post](https://wonderful-volhard-931295.netlify.app/posts/lets-create-a-habit/). That creating a new habit won’t be easy, I already knew that back in November, but I’ve never thought it would be THAT hard. I still want to become a frequent writer and now I have a new stimulus to accomplish that: now I’m investing money into it.

I’m not here to try to do the same promise again. I do want to make a habit of writing in English and now a see that, maybe, my approach to it was a bit too optimistic. So, let’s resume it under new terms.

Someone said that we are creatures of habits and I firmly believe that to be true. So, if I want to have the satisfaction of meeting my goal, I must commit to it in some way. Yes, creating a new good habit can be hard, but it could be very rewarding. I must always remember why I’m doing that. It should be something convenient for me to do it. I should find a pleasant way of inserting this new thing into my daily routine. Even if I’m only able to write a sentence on that day, I must definitely write it.

I professionally need to write (and speak) in English. This is part of the reward, part of the “why”, but it’s not all of it. I also want to feel less stressed and more confident when I need to use English. In my life, this happens all the time, and not only in professional environments, but also in personal moments. So, being able to communicate easily and be more relaxed will be my actual reward.

Talking about convenience, I figured a way to simplifying what I intended to do in order of creating a new text like this one. Initially, I’d use the editor of the Content Management System I’m using, to create my writings as a draft. That proved to be a terrible idea. Now I changed to a way more convenient online text editor, that’s always easy to access and ready for me to input content in it.

Finally, I’m yet to find a way to make this writing moment part of my routine. This is proving to be a daunting task since it’s very time-consuming and free time is so rare these days. Between planning, researching and writing, this text took me a whole day of work to be done. I’m counting on that practice will make it faster. Somehow.

Now I have fewer excuses not to write. I’m not completely free of them, but I’m also more motivated and with a simpler procedure to follow. The rewarding should surpass the hassle, at least inside my mind. Let’s see how many days it will take for me to come up with a third text.
